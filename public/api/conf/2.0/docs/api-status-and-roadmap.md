This API is currently in beta - expect some breaking changes.

This API provides endpoints for getting the status of a declaration by:
  
- MRN
- Declaration Unique Consignment Reference (DUCR)
- Unique Consignment Reference (UCR)
- Inventory Reference

The format of these endpoints are:

- /mrn/{mrn}/status
- /ducr/{ducr}/status
- /ucr/{ucr}/status
- /inventory-reference/{inventory-reference}/status
