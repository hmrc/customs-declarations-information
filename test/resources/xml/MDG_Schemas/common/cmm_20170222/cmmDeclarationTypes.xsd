    <xsd:annotation>
      <xsd:documentation>Part of the customs debt the payment of which is to be covered.

Note: the customs debt is currently made up of the following coverage amounts (types):
1:   FCA = Full Coverage Amount -&gt; Level 4: to cover all amounts not covered at a lower level being the sum of the payable and the security part of the customs debt.

2:   PP = Payment Part -&gt; Level 3: to cover the payment part inasmuch their constituent parts are not covered at a lower level (same as PA) The PP is the customs debt amount which is assumed to be effectively paid; equal to the sum of the Payable Vat Amount (PVA) and the Payable Non-Vat Amount (PNA)-&gt; same as PA

3:   SP = Security Part -&gt; Level 3: to cover the security part inasmuch their constituent parts are not covered at a lower level. The SP is the amount to be taken as security to cover all amounts not (immediately) payable, being the sum of the DMS security (DS) and the Tariff security (TS) amounts

4:   DS = DMS Security -&gt; level 2: to cover the DMS calculated security amounts inasmuch its parts are not covered at a lower level. DS is the sum of the secured relief or suspension amounts and secured provisional duties (SRA, SSA, PDS) determined by DMS. 

5:    TS = Tariff Security -&gt; level 2: to cover the Tariff calculated security amount inasmuch its parts are not covered at a lower level. TS is the sum of the preferential tariff security (PTS) and additional duty security (ADS) determined by Tariff, to be provided by the declarant as security should (higher) duties related to critical quota, missing preferential documents or additional duty apply

6:   ASA = Additional Security Amount -&gt; level 2/1: to cover the security amount entered by a customs official to be taken as security in case of a customs position release of goods (additional security) or 'clearance (additional security). ASA is the sum of security amounts of type 'additional security' on goods item level

7:   PNA = Payable Non-Vat Amount -&gt; Level 1: Part of the customs debt amount, equal to the sum of the duties/fees/taxes on goods item level, not being VAT, that is to be effectively paid (that is: not transferred, suspended, relieved or waived).

8:    PVA = Payable Vat Amount -&gt; Level 1: Part of the customs debt amount, being the sum of the Value Added Tax (VAT) amounts on goods item level, that is to be effectively paid (not being transferred to the VAT declaration of the consignee of the declared goods)

9:    SRA = Secured Relief Amount -&gt; Level 1: Part of the customs debt that is being relieved (exempted) and needs to be secured, being the sum of the secured relief amount amounts on goods item level

11:   SSA = Secured Suspension Amount -&gt; Level 1: Part of the customs debt that is being suspended (payment postponed until brought under another customs procedure) and secured, being the sum of the suspended amounts on goods item level. NOTE: no distinction is made between secured and non-secured suspension amounts yet

13:   PDS = Provisional Duty Security -&gt; Level 1: Amount to be taken as security to cover the exta duties that would have to be paid for the declaration should a provisional anti-dumping or countervailing duty apply. NOTE: sum of the security amount of type 'provisional duty' on goods item level

14:   ADS = Additional Duty Security -&gt; Level 1: Amount to be taken as security to cover the extra duties that would have to be paid for the declaration under certain conditions (e.g. in case of commodities like poultry and sugar or perishables) apply. NOTE: sum of the security amount of type 'additional duty' on goods item level (same as AS)

16: PA = payable amount -&gt; Level 2: to cover the payable amount inasmuch their constituent parts are not covered at a lower level (same as PP)

17: AS = Additional Security -&gt; level 2: to cover the security amount entered by a customs official to be taken as security (ASA) and any trader declared security amount (TDS)

20: PEA = Payable Excise Amount -&gt; Level 1: Part of the customs debt amount, being the sum of the Excise amounts on goods item level, that is to be effectively paid

21: TDS = Trader Declared Security -&gt; Level 1: Security as declared by the trader in UCC Annex B DE 4/6 and 4/8

22: PTS = Preferential Tariff Security-&gt; Level 1: Amount to be taken as security to cover the extra duties that would have to be paid for the declaration should the non-preferential tariff apply. Reasons could be quota, whose status was critical, has been exhausted or a preferential document, indicated to be missing in an incomplete declaration, will not be provided.</xsd:documentation>

A DutyTaxFee object consists (among other attributes) of the following fields: type: 			Object representing the type of tax base:			(Dutch: maatstaf): object of type 'Measure' representing the number of units on which the calculation of this tax part is 	based. At runtime, 'base' may 					dynamically adopt the form of one of the 'Measure' sub types 'MonetaryAmount' (an amount specified in a particular Currency), a 'Measurement' (a 				value in a particular MeasureUnitType) or 'Quantity' (a discrete value in a MeasureUnitType 'PCE' ). So a base always specifies a value and the unit type 				in which it is expressed rate:       (DU: Tarief): the applicable proportion or unit charge. The rate attribute is of also of type 'Measure' which, again, may adopt the form of one of its sub            types 'MonetaryAmount' (if the base is a Quantity or 'Percentage' (if the base is a Monetary Amount) givenAmount:  a derived value calculated by multiplying the measure base by the rate (taking the rate's unit type into account) Two examples may demonstrate this setup. Suppose a tax is based on the declared goods item value of 20.000 Euro and a tariff of 2.5% applies. In this case the DutyTaxFee object will contain the following fields: base:       a MonetaryAmount object with fields: value=20.000 and unitType[type='EUR'].symbol=€ rate:         a Percentage object with fields: value=2.5, unitType[code='P1'].symbol=% (the unit type indicates that the 'real' value is 2.5% = 0.025) givenAmount:    a MonetaryAmount object with value=500 and unitType[code='EUR'].symbol=€ Suppose a tax is based on the net weight of 4.000 KG of the goods items and a tariff of 0.50 EUR per KG.
