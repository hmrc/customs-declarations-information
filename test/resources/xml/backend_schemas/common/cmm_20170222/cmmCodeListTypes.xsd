The only exception is the descripton of code 9  which CCIPdescribes as 'own propulsion' and WPFITP as 'Mode Unknown'. To align both descriptions, we propose to rename the lable of code 9  to 'Mode Unknown/Own Propulsion' Code    Mode of Transport             Explanations 0       -                    In principle, this code should not be used since the digit '0' may be employed                               to indicate absence of entry, etc. If this is not the case, the code can be used when                               indication of a mode of transport would be irrelevant, e.g. statistical reporting                               should not take place (for samples, gifts, personal effect, etc.). 1       Maritime transport             Provision is made for separate reporting of inland water transport under code                               8, assuming that appropriate definitions and rules of application will be given,                               particularly when transport covers sea as well as inland waterways. 2       Rail transport                - 3       Road transport             - 4       Air transport                - 5       Mail               (Active mode of transport unknown) - This code is provided for practical                               reasons, despite the fact that mail is not a genuine mode of transport. In many                               countries, the value of merchandise exported and imported by mail is considerable,                               but the exporter or importer concerned would be unable to state by which                               mode postal items had passed the national border. 6       Multimodal transport          (Active mode of transport unknown) – This code is provided for practical                               reasons, despite the fact that multimodal transport is not a genuine mode of                               transport. It can be used when goods are carried by at least two different modes                               from a place at which the goods are taken in charge by a transport operator to                               a place designated for delivery, on the basis of one transport contract. (Operations                               of pick-up and delivery of goods carried out in the performance of a                               unimodal transport, as defined in such a contract, shall not be considered as                               multimodal transport.) 7       Fixed transport             This code applies to installations for continuous transport such as pipelines,                               installations ropeways and electric power lines. 8       Inland water transport          This code is used only in such cases where the application of waterborne                               transport is reported separately within the framework of a one-digit code. 9       Mode unknown/             This code can be used when the mode is not known or when information on it       Own Propulsion               is not available at the time of issuing the document concerned.

  <xsd:complexType name="CustomsWarehouseType">
    <xsd:annotation>
      <xsd:documentation>Objects that represent a type of customs warehouse NOTE: the following customs warehouse type are distinguished: Type A: a public warehouse where anybody can store their goods and where the warehouse keeper is responsible for fulfilling the obligations arising from the placing of goods under the Customs Warehouse procedure. Type B: A public warehouse where anybody can store their goods and where the depositor is responsible for fulfilling the obligations arising from the placing of goods under the Customs Warehouse procedure. Type B warehouses are often used by stevedores, agents and transport companies in ports to store goods for a limited time until the means of transport has arrived to further distribute the goods to the place of destination. Type C: A private warehouse where only the warehouse keeper can store goods, where the warehouse keeper is the same person as the depositor but is not necessarily the owner of the goods. Type D: A private warehouse where only the warehouse keeper can store his goods, where the warehouse keeper is the same person as the depositor but is not necessarily the owner of the goods. In contrast with the other warehouse types the Import Duties are calculated based on the rules of assessment ascertained or accepted at the time when the goods are placed under the Customs Warehousing system. This type of warehouse is quite similar to a type C warehouse Type E: A private warehouse where only the warehouse keeper can store his goods, where the warehouse keeper is the same person as the depositor but is not necessarily the owner of the goods. For this type of warehouse it is permitted to place the goods under the Warehouse Procedure without them being physically stored in a Customs Warehouse. This type of warehousing requires a high level administrative organisation including inventory records, as the physical location of the goods is not the key factor, but the fact that the goods are entered in the warehouse records. Customs must be able to follow the goods through the records system. This type of warehouse is the most sophisticated type which gives maximum flexibility to the warehouse keeper, but also requires a high level records system. Type F: A public warehouse where anybody can store their goods, which is operated by the Customs authorities. This type of warehouse is very rare. </xsd:documentation>

9:    SRA = Secured Relief Amount -&gt; Level 1: Part of the customs debt that is being relieved (exempted) and needs to be secured, being the sum of the secured relief amount amounts on goods item level

11:   SSA = Secured Suspension Amount -&gt; Level 1: Part of the customs debt that is being suspended (payment postponed until brought under another customs procedure) and secured, being the sum of the suspended amounts on goods item level. NOTE: no distinction is made between secured and non-secured suspension amounts yet

NOTE: sum of the security amount of type 'provisional duty' on goods item level

14:   ADS = Additional Duty Security -&gt; Level 1: Amount to be taken as security to cover the extra duties that would have to be paid for the declaration under certain conditions (e.g. in case of commodities like poultry and sugar or perishables) apply. NOTE: sum of the security amount of type 'additional duty' on goods item level (same as AS)

16: PA = payable amount -&gt; Level 2: to cover the payable amount inasmuch their constituent parts are not covered at a lower level (same as PP)

17: AS = Additional Security -&gt; level 2: to cover the security amount entered by a customs official to be taken as security (ASA) and any trader declared security amount (TDS)

20: PEA = Payable Excise Amount -&gt; Level 1: Part of the customs debt amount, being the sum of the Excise amounts on goods item level, that is to be effectively paid
